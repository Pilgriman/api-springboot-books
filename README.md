This repository is a complete CRUD application with Spring Boot, Java 11 and a database in memory. Through it, I have learned how to create the REST endpoints for creating, reading , updating and deleting entities in TDD-style (Test-Driven-Development). This project is also available in a tutorial video ministring by rieckpil.
